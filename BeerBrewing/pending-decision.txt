Decided to go with EF.  Just because I've used EF in a number of differenct scenarios and versions over the 
years all the way back to LINQ to SQL.   So there will be a EF specific project for persisting the objects 
and then hopefully some clean non-automapper mechanism for populating the actual domain objects.   Why no 
Automapper?  Because it's always ended up being a ghost in the machine for projects I or others have run. 
Mystery null exceptions, mystery deployment issues, build server issues.   Just another black box to configure around.
