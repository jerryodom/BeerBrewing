Step 3:  Have it write data to a MongoDB server to experiment with MongoDB.  This may get mixed in with the security piece if you develop it yourself rather than use an online provider.

Step 4:  Build some minor frontend in Angularjs, Ember, Ionic or ECMAscript.  Possibly Aurelia if that's continued to grow around here.
