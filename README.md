# BeerBrewing
Code n formulas relevant to beer brewers.   I don't get to code for fun anymore so I'm coding for fun.  
A while back I did the math to figure out all the formulas for IBU's, ABV, ABW, Attentuation and pretty 
much every other beer related calculation.   The code has transformed a number of times and never been 
reusable.  So I'm making reusable beer code for fun.  Yay 123. abc
